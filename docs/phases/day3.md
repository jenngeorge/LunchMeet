+ guest signin
+ redirect to signup page on logout (and any time signout at a root)
+ redirect to current user show page after profile update
+ upload profile photos with cloudinary (update state displays new photo on update view)
  - works on heroku (thx figaro)
+ set up custom domain: lunchmeet.network
