##Day 1 notes

### Stuff I did
+ completed Auth
+ completed User model/API/redux cycles
  - update needs more work: currently takes an id and user_params,
   so user_params accepts a user id which is hacky and needs to change
+ deployed to heroku
+ added bootstrap
+ sassy architecture for beautiful stylz
+ auth styling

### Notes
+ made User responsible for 'signup' rather than Session
  - Signup == submitting profile information
+ sign up form will bleed into profile creation (either change validations or change UI)
