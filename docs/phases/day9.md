##Day 9 notes

### Stuff I did
+ seed conversations
+ message model, controller, api
+ conversation model, controller, api
+ conversation and match redux loops
  - decided to filter conversations by currentUser in the conversation controller,
  then store in state separately from currentUser's state
+ conversations display to conversation index page
+ conversation participants are accessible from the conversation index
+ nest messages by conversation_id in react router


###notes
+ do model validations after everything works
+ form security
+ future: delete all messages if a conversation is deleted
+ creating a first message also creates the conversation ~ how to deal

+ end of day -- issues getting messages to display
